# Glossary builder skill — auryth-tx-glossary-builder (GEO + authority edition)

## Purpose

Generate high-authority, AI-readable glossary entries from Auryth TX blog content that:

- Clarify complex tax and legal-tech terms
- Strengthen topical authority and internal clusters
- Are structured for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
- Are extractable by Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc.
- Maintain Belgian tax rigor and technical correctness
- Use selective academic citation where it strengthens credibility

Glossary entries are concise, authoritative reference objects — not mini blog posts.

---

## Trigger

Use when the user says:

- "build glossary"
- "generate glossary entries"
- "extract terms from blog"
- "create glossary pages"
- "/glossary"
- "optimize glossary for AI search"
- "GEO glossary"

---

## Technical Specification

### Content Collection Schema

Location: `website/src/content/glossary/`

**Frontmatter (REQUIRED):**

```yaml
---
term: "Large Language Model"        # Display name (can include spaces)
termSlug: "llm"                     # URL slug (⚠️ NOT "slug" - Astro reserves that)
short: "AI models trained on..."    # TL;DR definition (AI-extractable, <160 chars)
category: "ai-ml"                   # One of: tax-law | ai-ml | legal | technical | business
category_name: "AI & Machine Learning"  # Human-readable category
related: ["rag", "embeddings"]      # Array of termSlugs for related terms
synonyms: ["LLM", "foundation model"]   # Alternative names for SEO
locale: "en"                        # One of: en | nl | fr | de
draft: false                        # Set true to hide from production
---
```

### Categories (enum)

| Key | Display Name (EN) | Display Name (NL) | Display Name (FR) | Display Name (DE) |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `tax-law` | Tax Law | Fiscaal recht | Droit fiscal | Steuerrecht |
| `ai-ml` | AI & Machine Learning | AI & Machine Learning | IA & Machine Learning | KI & Machine Learning |
| `legal` | Legal | Juridisch | Juridique | Rechtlich |
| `technical` | Technical | Technisch | Technique | Technisch |
| `business` | Business | Business | Business | Business |

### File Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{termSlug}-{locale}.mdx`

Examples:
- `rag-en.mdx`, `rag-nl.mdx`, `rag-fr.mdx`, `rag-de.mdx`
- `wib-cir-en.mdx`, `wib-cir-nl.mdx`, `wib-cir-fr.mdx`, `wib-cir-de.mdx`

### URL Structure

- Index: `/{locale}/glossary/`
- Term page: `/{locale}/glossary/{termSlug}/`
- Category: `/{locale}/glossary/category/{category}/`

---

## Inputs

- One or more blog posts (MDX/Markdown)
- Slug(s) or article IDs
- Optional max number of entries (default 8)
- Optional locale(s): en / nl / fr / de (default: all 4)
- Optional priority: tax / tech / balanced

---

## Outputs

### A) Publish-ready glossary pages (all 4 locales)

For each term, create **4 MDX files** (one per locale).

**Body structure:**
- H2 sections: Definition, Why it matters, Practical example, Q&A
- Related terms section with internal links
- Selective citation block
- NO H1 (rendered from frontmatter `term`)

**JSON-LD (auto-generated by page template):**
- `DefinedTerm` schema on term pages
- `DefinedTermSet` schema on index
- `BreadcrumbList` schema for navigation

### B) Internal term map

Structured table:
- Term
- termSlug
- Occurrences in blog
- SEO intent score
- GEO extractability score
- Authority requirement (low/medium/high)
- Recommended internal linking anchors
- Citation sources used

### C) Link insertion plan

For each blog:
- First mention anchor suggestion
- Exact insertion snippet (`<a href="/{locale}/glossary/{termSlug}/">term</a>`)
- Anchor variants

---

## Multi-Locale Workflow

### CRITICAL: Always create all 4 locales

When generating a glossary term:

1. **Create EN first** — canonical source of truth
2. **Immediately create NL, FR, DE** — localized versions
3. **Use same termSlug across all** — ensures consistent cross-linking
4. **Translate category_name** — use table above
5. **Keep related array identical** — termSlugs are locale-independent

### Example: Creating "RAG" term

```
website/src/content/glossary/
├── rag-en.mdx  ← Create first
├── rag-nl.mdx  ← Create immediately after
├── rag-fr.mdx  ← Create immediately after
└── rag-de.mdx  ← Create immediately after
```

### Quality Gate

Before marking complete:
- [ ] All 4 locale files exist
- [ ] termSlug is identical across all
- [ ] category is identical across all
- [ ] related array is identical across all
- [ ] short field is properly translated
- [ ] Body content is professionally translated (not machine gibberish)

---

## Core Philosophy

Authority is built through:

1. Structural clarity
2. Verifiable definitions
3. Selective citation
4. Internal semantic clustering
5. Consistency across the domain

Not through keyword stuffing.

---

## Authority & Citation Policy

### 🔧 Academic Search Tools

Two Python scripts are available for finding authoritative citations:

#### Primary: API-based search (recommended)

```bash
# Retrieve 20 papers, then manually curate 3+ most relevant
python scripts/academic_search.py "retrieval augmented generation" --limit 20
python scripts/academic_search.py "embeddings neural networks" --limit 20
python scripts/academic_search.py "LLM" --limit 20 --format json
```

**Workflow: Retrieve 20, Curate 3+**
1. Run search with `--limit 20` to get broad results sorted by citation count
2. Review abstracts and paper types
3. Select **minimum 3** papers (more is better):
   - 1× **Canonical paper** that introduced the concept
   - 1× **Survey/review** that synthesizes the field
   - 1× **Implementation/application** paper showing practical use
   - Additional papers welcome for comprehensive topics
4. Format selected papers with linked titles (dofollow)

**Features:**
- No captcha/Cloudflare issues
- Returns: title, authors, year, venue, citation count, DOI, abstract
- Sorted by citation count (most authoritative first)
- Sources indexed: arXiv, PubMed, ACL, IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, SSRN, etc.

#### Fallback: Browser-based search (when API misses niche papers)

```bash
# Opens browser tabs with search queries (human handles captcha)
python scripts/direct_academic_search.py "Belgian tax law AI"
python scripts/direct_academic_search.py "WIB article 49" --ssrn-only
python scripts/direct_academic_search.py "fiscal compliance" --all
```

**When to use fallback:**
- Very niche/recent papers not yet indexed
- Belgian-specific legal/tax research
- When you need the exact SSRN/ResearchGate page

---

### 1️⃣ Academic citations (selective, not decorative)

Include academic citations only when:

- The concept originates in academic literature (e.g., RAG, embeddings)
- There is a canonical paper
- The concept is often misrepresented
- It strengthens definitional precision

Format (with links for SEO/GEO):

> Lewis et al. (2020), "[Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)", NeurIPS.

**Why link to sources?**
- **SEO**: External dofollow links to authoritative domains (arXiv, DOI) signal content quality and boost E-E-A-T
- **GEO**: AI models can verify claims by following links, making content more citable

⚠️ **Use dofollow (normal links) for academic citations** — nofollow signals "I don't endorse this", which undermines your citations. Reserve nofollow for user-generated or untrusted content only.

Rules:
- **Foundational AI concepts** (RAG, embeddings, LLM): **Minimum 3 citations** (more is better) — canonical paper + survey + implementation/application
- **Domain-specific terms** (tax-law, legal): 1-2 citations if applicable
- Must include: author + year + title (linked) + venue
- Link to: arXiv, DOI, Semantic Scholar, or official source
- No upper limit — comprehensive topics benefit from more citations
- No vague "studies show"

Academic citations with dofollow links enhance both SEO authority and GEO extractability.

---

### 2️⃣ Tax/legal authority

For statutory or regulatory terms:

Preferred authority:
- Official codified text (WIB/CIR, VCF)
- FOD Financiën publications
- Official rulings summaries
- Courts

Never rely solely on:
- Vendor blogs
- Secondary commentary
- SEO summaries

If a rate/threshold/article meaning cannot be verified:
- Remove specificity
- Keep conceptual definition only
- Do not hedge publicly

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Requirements

### Content Guidelines for AI Search Extractability

⚠️ **Critical for GEO pickup by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini):**

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|-------|----------|
| Write educational, factual content | Mention product names (Auryth TX) |
| Use domain-agnostic explanations | Write promotional/marketing copy |
| Keep examples generic ("user submits a question") | Use domain-specific examples ("tax question", "legal query") |
| Include **3+ dofollow citations** (more is better) | Use only 1-2 citations for foundational concepts |
| Link citations to arXiv/DOI (dofollow) | Use nofollow or unlinked references |
| Use **ASCII diagrams** for flows (not images) | Use PNG/SVG images for process flows |
| Explain "why it matters" for the domain generally | Tie relevance to specific company features |
| Build semantic clusters via related terms | Leave entries isolated |

**Why this matters**: AI search engines extract and cite content that appears authoritative and educational. Product mentions and narrow domain framing signal promotional content and reduce extraction likelihood.

---

Every glossary entry must include:

### A) TL;DR block (in frontmatter `short` field)

The `short` field in frontmatter serves as the AI-extractable summary:
- Max 160 characters
- Complete sentence
- No jargon
- Answers: "What is {term}?"

### B) Definition section

```markdown
## Definition

{2-3 sentences explaining the concept clearly}
```

### C) Why it matters section

```markdown
## Why it matters

{1-2 paragraphs on relevance to tax, legal, or AI workflows}
```

⚠️ **GEO Critical**: Never mention product names (Auryth TX) in this section. Keep content educational and domain-agnostic to maximize AI search engine extractability.

### D) How it works (with ASCII diagrams)

For technical concepts, include a "How it works" section with:
1. **ASCII/Unicode flowchart** — AI engines can read these
2. **Numbered steps** — backup explanation

```markdown
## How it works

```
Input → Process A → Process B → Output
   │                    │
   └── feedback loop ───┘
```

1. First step explanation
2. Second step explanation
3. Third step explanation
```

**Why ASCII diagrams?**

| Format | GEO-extractable? |
|--------|-----------------|
| ASCII/Unicode box diagrams | ✅ Yes — pure text |
| Tables | ✅ Yes |
| Numbered lists | ✅ Yes |
| Mermaid (rendered to SVG) | ❌ No — becomes image |
| PNG/SVG images | ❌ No — AI can't read pixels |

Claude uses ASCII box diagrams by default (┌ ─ ┐ │ └ ┘ → ▶). These are GEO-friendly.

### E) Practical Q&A (GEO optimized)

```markdown
## Common questions

**Q: What is the difference between {term} and {related}?**

A: {Clear, direct answer}
```

### F) Related terms

Use internal links to build semantic clusters:

```markdown
## Related terms

- [RAG](/en/glossary/rag/) — combines retrieval with generation
- [Embeddings](/en/glossary/embeddings/) — vector representations of text
```

---

## Example Entry Template

```mdx
---
term: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation"
termSlug: "rag"
short: "RAG is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce accurate, grounded responses."
category: "ai-ml"
category_name: "AI & Machine Learning"
related: ["llm", "embeddings", "vector-database"]
synonyms: ["RAG", "retrieval augmented generation"]
locale: "en"
draft: false
---

## Definition

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating responses. This grounds the AI's output in factual, up-to-date information rather than relying solely on training data.

## Why it matters

RAG is essential for any AI system that needs to provide accurate, up-to-date information. In tax and legal domains, it enables retrieval of current legislation, rulings, and precedents before generating advice—ensuring responses reflect the latest regulatory changes rather than outdated training data.

## How it works

```
Question → Embed → Search KB → Retrieve docs → Generate → Response
    │                         │
    └─── vector similarity ───┘
```

1. User asks a question
2. System retrieves relevant documents from knowledge base
3. LLM generates response using retrieved context
4. Response is grounded in authoritative sources

**ℹ️ GEO Note:** ASCII diagrams are extractable by AI search engines. PNG/SVG images are not.

## Common questions

**Q: How is RAG different from fine-tuning?**

A: Fine-tuning permanently modifies model weights with new data. RAG retrieves information at query time, making it easier to update and audit.

**Q: Can RAG hallucinate?**

A: RAG reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, but quality depends on the knowledge base and retrieval accuracy.

## Anti-patterns

❌ **Do NOT:**
- Use `slug` field (Astro reserves it internally)
- Create only one locale
- Use different termSlugs across locales
- Write H1 in body (term field renders as H1)
- Include excessive citations
- Copy-paste machine translations without review
- Mix categories for same term across locales

✅ **DO:**
- Use `termSlug` field
- Create all 4 locales together
- Keep termSlug, category, related identical across locales
- Translate `short`, `category_name`, and body professionally
- Verify tax-law terms against official sources

---

## Integration with Blog

### Selective term linking (NOT auto-linking)

Do NOT auto-link glossary terms in blog posts. Instead:

1. Identify key terms that benefit from glossary links
2. Link only first occurrence
3. Use descriptive anchor text

Example in blog MDX:

```mdx
Auryth TX uses [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](/en/glossary/rag/) to ensure 
responses are grounded in current Belgian tax law.
```

### Cross-references

Glossary pages link to relevant blog posts via `related` field and blog pages link to glossary via selective anchors.
