79% of legal professionals now use AI.
Tax firm adoption tripled in one year — from 9% to 41%.
Firms with an AI strategy see ROI at 3.1x the rate of non-adopters.

But here's the number that matters most:

40% of tax and accounting firms still have no significant AI adoption plans.

This isn't a bell curve where everyone gradually shifts. It's a bimodal distribution — strategic adopters pulling away from non-adopters. The gap is widening, not closing.

For Belgian tax professionals, the window carries an extra dimension. The global players aren't building for Belgium. The specialized tools that cover Belgian tax law are emerging now. The practitioners who build competence today are compounding an advantage.

Our latest article breaks down the data from Clio, Thomson Reuters, Wolters Kluwer, ABA, McKinsey, and BCG — with specific implications for Belgian practice.
