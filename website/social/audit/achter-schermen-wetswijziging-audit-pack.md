## Changes applied
None — all claims verified.

## Flagged but not changed
- The 141,310 pages figure is approximate and may vary by year — acceptable as order-of-magnitude claim
- VersionRAG improvement figures are from a specific benchmark; real-world results may vary
- NL/FR/DE "Related articles" sections may contain EN-locale URLs — systematic localization issue
