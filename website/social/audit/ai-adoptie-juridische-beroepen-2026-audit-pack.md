## Changes applied
None — no false claims identified. BCG figure flagged for potential overstatement.

## Flagged but not changed

- **BCG "15-20 hours weekly"**: BCG's publicly available reports cite "5+ hours per week" saved by 58% of users. The "15-20 hours" figure may come from a specific BCG consulting engagement or refer to top-performing strategic adopters, but the exact figure could not be confirmed in the BCG AI Radar PDF. Consider qualifying as "up to 15-20 hours for strategic adopters" or adjusting to the verifiable "5+ hours per week"
- McKinsey "71% implementation" — consistent with McKinsey Global Survey but exact figure not cross-checked against original report
- NL/FR/DE locales consistent with EN
