## Changes applied
None — all factual claims verified or plausible with consistent attribution.

## Flagged but not changed

- **486 case count may be stale by publication date (March 2026)**: Charlotin database shows 700+ by end 2025. The 486 figure likely comes from a mid-2025 Jones Walker report. Numbers lack explicit date qualifier — "as of mid-2025" would improve precision, but current framing is not false for when data was gathered
- **Jones Walker dependency progression framework**: Attribution is plausible but the specific four-stage model could not be independently verified in Jones Walker publications. The framework itself is sound and consistent with AI adoption research
- **September 2025 sanctions for failure to detect fake citations**: Specific case not independently verified, but consistent with legal community reporting on expanding verification duties
- NL/FR/DE locales are consistent with EN — no locale-specific errors
