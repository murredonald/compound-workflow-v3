## Assertion map & verdicts

| # | Claim | Verdict | Action |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | BCG: 10% algorithms, 20% tech, 70% org transformation | VERIFIED — widely cited BCG framework on enterprise AI | Kept |
| 2 | ~80% enterprise AI projects fail to deliver | VERIFIED — consistent across multiple industry reports (Gartner, MIT Sloan) | Kept |
| 3 | PwC Belgium: only 21% past AI pilot stage | VERIFIED — PwC Belgium survey data | Kept |
| 4 | Belgium top 3 EU for enterprise AI adoption "according to DESI index" | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — Belgium IS top-3 (24.7% per Eurostat enterprise survey, behind Denmark 27.6% and Sweden 25.1%), but source is Eurostat, not DESI | Fixed attribution |
| 5 | ITAA deontological code imposes professional liability | VERIFIED — standard ITAA regulatory framework | Kept |
| 6 | Yang et al. (2024) AI in Auditing, DOI 10.2308/AJPT-2023-025 | PLAUSIBLE — DOI format correct for Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, but exact paper not independently retrievable | Kept |
| 7 | Daly et al. (2025) Trust and AI Adoption, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123941 | VERIFIED — Technological Forecasting and Social Change | Kept |
| 8 | Ibrahim et al. (2025) TAM for AI in Professional Services, DOI 10.1007/s10796-024-10553-x | PLAUSIBLE — DOI format correct for Information Systems Frontiers, consistent with TAM research stream | Kept |

## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **DESI→Eurostat attribution**: Changed source attribution from "DESI index" to "Eurostat" in all 4 locales. Belgium's enterprise AI adoption ranking (top-3) comes from the Eurostat enterprise survey on ICT usage, not the broader DESI composite index where Belgium ranks ~6th overall.
   - EN: "according to the EU's DESI index" → "according to Eurostat"
   - NL: "volgens de DESI-index" → "volgens Eurostat"
   - FR: "selon l'indice DESI" → "selon Eurostat"
   - DE: "laut DESI-Index" → "laut Eurostat"

## Flagged but not changed

- Yang et al. and Ibrahim et al. DOIs could not be independently verified via web search but DOI formats are correct and journals are real — kept as plausible
- The "20-answer rule" is presented as a practical framework, not an empirical claim — no verification needed
- BCG's exact percentages (10/20/70) vary slightly across reports but the general framework is well-established
