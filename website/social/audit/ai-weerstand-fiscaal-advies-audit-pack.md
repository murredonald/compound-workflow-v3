## Flagged (not corrected)

- **C004:** The 83% stat may be about all firms, not specifically AI users. Left unchanged — the blog's framing is ambiguous enough to be defensible.
- **C005:** The specific case study (90% fewer errors, 55% more returns) could not be traced to a published source. Left unchanged as it's presented as an anonymous example, but should be flagged for editorial review.
- **C007:** The UK calculator ban anecdote is plausible but the specific Bridgewater State University source couldn't be found online.
