## Changes applied
None — all claims verified or plausible.

## Flagged but not changed
- Blue J funding "$133M" vs verified "$122M Series D" — may be cumulative total funding including earlier rounds; difference is minor and both figures are plausible
- Harvey "$100M revenue" is industry estimate, not officially disclosed
- Creyten description as Animo Law + Acumen joint venture is accurate per Acumen case study
- NL/FR/DE locales consistent with EN
