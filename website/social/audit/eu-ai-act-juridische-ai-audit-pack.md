## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **OVB/alice.law citation**: Separated into "OVB (2025). AI-richtlijnen voor advocaten. ovb.be" + "See also: Alice.law (2025)..." — same pattern as posts 17 and earlier
2. **FR locale only — NOvA description**: Changed "ordre néerlandophone des avocats" → "ordre des avocats néerlandais" — néerlandophone means Dutch-speaking, not Netherlands

## Flagged but not changed

- Timeline section lists Feb 2, 2026 AFTER Aug 2, 2026 (chronologically backwards) — intentional: puts enforcement date first, then preparatory guidance. Not a factual error
- €193,000–€330,000 provider compliance costs are unattributed consulting estimates — acceptable since used to contrast with deployer costs (essentially zero)
- ITAA-Barometer percentages cannot be independently verified but source (blogitaa.be) is authoritative
- NL/FR/DE "Related articles" sections contain EN-locale URLs — systematic localization issue, not a factual error; noted for separate cleanup
- Ooms & Gils SSRN paper could benefit from a DOI link but SSRN papers don't always have DOIs
