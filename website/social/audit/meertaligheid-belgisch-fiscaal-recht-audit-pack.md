## Changes applied
None — all claims verified. This post is primarily structural/constitutional description rather than empirical claims.

## Flagged but not changed
- Tradcas project referenced but not cited with a specific URL — acceptable since it's a well-known Court of Cassation initiative
- The post makes no quantitative claims that require empirical verification — all assertions are about Belgium's constitutional language structure
