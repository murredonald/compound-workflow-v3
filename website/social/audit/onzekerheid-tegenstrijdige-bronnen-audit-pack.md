## Changes applied
None — all claims verified or plausible with appropriate sourcing.

## Flagged but not changed
- Specific Court of Cassation case dates (October 2023, October 2024) not independently verified — but PwC Legal Belgium article confirms the legal uncertainty exists, and the post frames these as illustrative examples with treaty context
- The $31,000 upper sanction figure could not be verified against a specific case but is within the range of reported AI-related court sanctions
