## Assertion map & verdicts

| # | Claim | Verdict | Action |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Flanders inheritance tax table (2026 reform) | INCORRECT — showed 3% for first €50,000 instead of 0% (tax-free). Bracket structure garbled. | Fixed: 0% on first €50K, 3%/9%* with footnote explaining Flanders brackets differ |
| 2 | Wallonia registration duty: 3% with €40,000 abattement | INCORRECT — €40,000 abattement was suspended when 3% rate took effect (Jan 1, 2025) | Fixed: removed abattement from table, corrected calculation €10,800 → €12,000 |
| 3 | Brussels registration duty: 12.5% with €200,000 abattement | VERIFIED (for properties under €600,000) | Kept |
| 4 | Flanders registration: 2% own residence | VERIFIED — reduced from 3% on Jan 1, 2025 | Kept |
| 5 | Property tax base rates: FL 2.5%, WA 1.25%, BXL 1.25% | VERIFIED — all from official sources | Kept |
| 6 | Flanders partner exemption €50K→€75K on Jan 1, 2026 | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 7 | Flanders gift clawback 3→5 years Jan 1, 2025 | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 8 | Brussels gift clawback 3→5 years Jan 1, 2026 | VERIFIED — Brussels ordinance July 2025 | Kept |
| 9 | Wallonia 2028 reform: rates halved, 15% max | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 10 | Siblings max: FL 55%, WA 65%, BXL ~65% | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 11 | Others max: FL 55%, WA 80%, BXL ~80% | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 12 | Opening example: €200K inheritance FL ≈€7,500, WA ≈€15,800 | PLAUSIBLE — directionally correct for reformed rates but depends on exact bracket application | Kept (directionally sound) |

## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **Inheritance tax table**: Flanders first €50,000 changed from "3%" to "0% (tax-free)". Second bracket from "9% (3% on first €150K from reform)" to "3%". Third bracket marked "3%/9%*" with footnote.
2. **Registration duty table**: Wallonia "Key benefit" changed from "€40,000 abattement" to "Reduced rate replaced former abattement system"
3. **Registration duty calculation**: Wallonia example €10,800 → €12,000 (3% × €400,000, no abattement)

## Flagged but not changed

- Gift tax movable 3%/7% is uniform across regions — VERIFIED
- Average property tax rates (~46% FL, ~55% WA, ~55% BXL) — plausible but hard to pin to a single year; left as approximations
- Citations are institutional (FPS Finance, CMS, KPMG, Notaire.be, PwC, Vlaanderen.be) — no dofollow links needed (no DOIs/arXiv)
