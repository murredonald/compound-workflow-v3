## Changes applied
None — all claims verified.

## Flagged but not changed
- The post frames misgrounding as "more dangerous" than fabrication — this is an editorial interpretation, not a factual claim, and is defensible
- NL/FR/DE "Related articles" sections may contain EN-locale URLs — systematic localization issue
