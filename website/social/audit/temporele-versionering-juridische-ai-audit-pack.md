| # | Claim | Verdict | Action |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Corporate tax: 33.99% pre-2018, 29.58% 2018-2019, 25% from 2020 | VERIFIED — including crisis surcharge breakdown | Kept |
| 2 | Notional interest deduction abolished Dec 2022 omnibus law | VERIFIED — effective taxable periods ending from Dec 31, 2023 | Kept |
| 3 | Pillar Two: IIR from Dec 31, 2023; UTPR from Dec 31, 2024 | VERIFIED — technically "fiscal years starting on or after" | Kept (minor wording imprecision acceptable) |

| 5 | Belgisch Staatsblad electronic only since 2003 | VERIFIED — paper discontinued Jan 1, 2003 | Kept |
| 6 | Consolidated texts lag 3-5 months | PLAUSIBLE — consistent with general knowledge of Belgian legislative databases | Kept |
| 7 | Jura side-by-side comparison since 2000 | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — consolidated legislation since 2000 true, side-by-side feature more recent | Reworded to separate the two facts |

| 9 | Assessment year = income year + 1 | VERIFIED — standard Belgian tax principle | Kept |
| 10 | Regional reforms: Flanders 2026, Wallonia 2028 | VERIFIED | Kept |

## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **Jura claim**: Reworded from implying side-by-side comparison existed since 2000 to separating: consolidated legislation since 2000 + side-by-side comparison as current feature

## Flagged but not changed

- Citations are all institutional (PwC, Deloitte, Bird & Bird, CMS, European Forum) — no dofollow links to add (no DOIs)
- "D+1" legislative index update claim is plausible but specific timing unverifiable — left as-is
- The 2019 rate of 29.58% is sometimes cited as 29.58% or 29% + surcharge — article correctly explains both
