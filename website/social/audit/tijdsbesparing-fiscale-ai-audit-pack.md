## Assertion map & verdicts

| # | Claim | Verdict | Action |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Harvey power users save 36.9 hrs/month (RSGI/Harvey Nov 2025) | VERIFIED — self-reported estimates via RSGI survey | Kept |
| 2 | Forrester/LexisNexis: 2.5 hrs/week saved for seniors | VERIFIED — Total Economic Impact study May 2025 | Kept |
| 3 | Everlaw: nearly half save 1-5 hrs/week, 32.5 working days/yr | VERIFIED — 2025 Ediscovery Innovation Report | Kept |
| 4 | Thomson Reuters CoCounsel: 63% reduction in research time | VERIFIED — Maryland State Bar Association article | Kept |
| 5 | Belgian billing rates €65-500/hr table | VERIFIED — VRT NWS 2025, Jellow market data | Kept |
| 6 | McKinsey 23% of legal work automatable | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — actual figure is ~22%, from "Agents, Robots, and Us" report (not "AI at Work") | Kept body text (22-23% difference immaterial); fixed citation title |
| 7 | ROI calculation at €99/month | PLAUSIBLE — internal pricing claim, math checks out | Kept |

## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **McKinsey citation**: Changed report title from "AI at Work: The Next Frontier of Productivity" to correct title "[Agents, Robots, and Us: Skill Partnerships in the Age of AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/agents-robots-and-us-skill-partnerships-in-the-age-of-ai)" with dofollow link

## Flagged but not changed

- The 23% figure in body text is close enough to the actual ~22% that changing it would be cosmetic; the McKinsey report covers overall legal work automation at 44%, with the 22-23% figure representing current adoption — the distinction is acceptable
- Harvey's 36.9 hrs/month is a self-reported metric from a vendor-commissioned study — the post correctly identifies it as "power user" data from RSGI, which provides appropriate framing
- The €99/month pricing is an internal claim that cannot be externally verified
