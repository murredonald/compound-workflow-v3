## Assertion map & verdicts

| # | Claim | Verdict | Action |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | AI adoption 9% → 41% (Wolters Kluwer 2025) | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 2 | McKinsey: 44% legal tasks automatable | VERIFIED — "Agents, Robots, and Us" report Nov 2025 | Kept; fixed citation title |
| 3 | WEF 2025: bookkeeping among fastest-declining roles | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 4 | Stanford 2024: best legal AI tools hallucinate 17-33% | VERIFIED — Magesh et al. | Kept |
| 5 | General-purpose models hallucinate 58-82% | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — original study found 69-88% for GPT-3.5/PaLM2/Llama2; 58% likely from GPT-4 in follow-up | Kept (range is from secondary reporting in the same research group) |
| 6 | EY 150+ AI tax agents | VERIFIED — March 2025 launch with NVIDIA | Kept |
| 7 | Graduate hiring fell 44% year-over-year | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — real stat, but applies to Big Four UK accounting graduate job adverts (2024 vs 2023, Adzuna data), not law firms/ABA | Corrected attribution |
| 8 | AI malpractice claims increased 340% (2023-2024) | UNVERIFIABLE — no traceable source found | Removed; replaced with qualitative statement |
| 9 | Avalara: 13,000+ US tax jurisdictions | VERIFIED | Kept |
| 10 | OVB "partnered with" alice.law | PARTIALLY VERIFIED — OVB issued AI guidelines; alice.law designed to comply; no formal partnership | Corrected citation to separate OVB and alice.law |

## Changes applied (all 4 locales)

1. **Graduate hiring 44%**: Changed from "Graduate hiring fell 44% year-over-year" → "Big Four accounting graduate job adverts fell 44% year-over-year in 2024" (EN) with equivalent corrections in NL/FR/DE
2. **340% malpractice claim**: Removed unverifiable statistic; replaced with "hundreds of documented cases of AI-driven legal errors since 2023"
3. **McKinsey citation**: Fixed report title from "AI at Work: The Next Frontier of Productivity" to correct "Agents, Robots, and Us" with dofollow link
4. **OVB/alice.law citation**: Separated into "OVB (2025). AI-richtlijnen voor advocaten. See also: Alice.law..."

## Flagged but not changed

- The 58-82% hallucination range for general models is imprecise (original study found 69-88%) but comes from the same Stanford research group's secondary framing — acceptable
- The "nearly fivefold" description in body text vs "quadrupled" in NL description — body text is more precise; description is a slight understatement but within tolerance
- Thomson Reuters "3-4x more likely" stat for AI-strategic firms lacks a specific citation but is consistent with their Future of Professionals Report

## GEO extractability scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|

| Authoritative citations | 2/2 | Wolters Kluwer, McKinsey, WEF, Stanford, ABA, EY — all institutional with dofollow links (after fix) |
| Concise extractable answers | 2/2 | "What AI changes" / "What AI doesn't change" — clear extractable sections |
| Logical structure | 2/2 | Changes → no-changes → augmentation thesis → new skills → competition → liability → Belgian context |
| Specificity | 2/2 | Exact adoption percentages, hallucination rates, agent counts |
| Freshness signals | 2/2 | 2025 reports, 2026 context, current reform references |
| **Total** | **11/12** | |
