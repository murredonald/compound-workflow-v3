Your legal AI tool treats a ministerial circular and a Court of Cassation ruling as equally relevant.

That's not a bug. It's a missing feature called authority ranking.

Standard AI search ranks by semantic similarity — which document uses the most similar language to your query. The problem: a circular can use almost identical language to the statute it interprets while having zero binding force.

In December 2023, the Belgian Court of Cassation ruled on withholding tax reclaim deadlines — contradicting prior case law. The tax administration responded with Circular 2025/C/56, maintaining its previous position.

A generic AI system ranks the circular first (most similar text). The Court of Cassation ruling? Third.

Same documents. Completely different professional risk depending on which appears first.

Article 159 of the Belgian Constitution empowers courts to set aside any circular that contradicts the law. Your AI should know that hierarchy too.
