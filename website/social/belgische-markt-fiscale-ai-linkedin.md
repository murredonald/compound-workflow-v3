Harvey raised $760M in 2025 alone. $8B valuation.
Blue J secured $133M. Partnership with IBFD.
Legora hit $1.8B after expanding to 40 countries.

None of them can tell you whether erfbelasting in Brussels is calculated differently from Flanders.

None of them cover the Vlaamse Codex Fiscaliteit. None can retrieve a ruling from the Dienst Voorafgaande Beslissingen. None can explain how a December 2025 programmawet changed Art. 19bis WIB 92.

The conventional wisdom says Belgium is too small. 12,000 tax professionals. Three languages. A regulatory patchwork that would scare off any product manager.

Belgium's 52.6% tax wedge (highest in the OECD). Three regions with distinct tax codes. Bilingual legislation. Programme laws rewriting provisions twice a year.

That complexity isn't a market obstacle. It IS the market.
