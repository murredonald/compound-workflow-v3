# Email snippet — A04: Estate planning across three regions

**Subject:** Same inheritance, three different tax bills — a Belgian estate planning case study

**Preview text:** A €2M estate in Antwerp. The surviving spouse's tax varies by €40,000 depending on which region applies. Here's the full breakdown.

---

Marc and Sofie De Smet live in Antwerp with roughly €2 million in combined assets. When Marc dies, the inheritance tax picture depends entirely on the region — and the differences are striking.

In Flanders (2026 reformed rates): €40,000–€55,000 for the surviving spouse. In Wallonia (pre-2028 reform): €75,000–€95,000. Same family. Same assets. Up to €40,000 difference.

We walked through the complete analysis: three regional rate tables, four planning strategies (registered gift, gesplitste aankoop, maatschap, the Walloon 2028 reform option), and the common misconceptions that cost families money — like assuming the heir's region determines the tax rate.

The most important insight: a registered gift at 3% almost always beats inheritance tax at 9–30%. The break-even is immediate for any amount above €50,000.
