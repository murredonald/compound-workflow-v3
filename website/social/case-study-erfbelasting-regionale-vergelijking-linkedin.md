# LinkedIn post — A04: Estate planning across three regions

A couple in Antwerp. €2 million in assets. Two adult children — one in Brussels, one in Ghent.

Simple question: what happens to the estate when one parent dies?

The answer depends entirely on which region's inheritance tax applies. And the differences are not marginal:

→ Flanders (2026): surviving spouse pays approximately €40,000–€55,000
→ Wallonia: same estate, same family — €75,000–€95,000
→ Brussels: €65,000–€85,000

That's a potential €40,000 gap between regions. For the exact same inheritance.

But here's what most advisors miss: the children's region of residence is irrelevant. Lisa in Brussels pays Flemish rates — because Marc lived in Antwerp. The deceased's last fiscal domicile determines everything.

And then there's the planning dimension:

→ A registered gift at 3% vs. inheritance tax at 27%
→ A maatschap that removes €800K from the estate for €24K in gift tax
→ A gesplitste aankoop that passes real estate to children tax-free

The Walloon 2028 reform will halve direct-line rates to a maximum of 15%. For Walloon families with elderly parents in good health, the timing question is real: plan aggressively now, or wait?

Every estate planning question in Belgium is actually three questions — one per region. And the complete answer requires cross-referencing three legal codes in two languages.
