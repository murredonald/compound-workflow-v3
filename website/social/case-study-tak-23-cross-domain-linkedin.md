# LinkedIn post — A03: TAK 23 case study

A client asks about their TAK 23 investment. You cover the income tax side. You mention the premium tax.

Three months later, the notary calls about inheritance tax — in a different region than you assumed.

You didn't miss anything you knew about. You missed what you didn't think to look for.

One TAK 23 contract touches at least five tax regimes:

1. Insurance premium tax (2%)
2. Capital gains tax (10% from 2026)
3. Withholding tax (30% — conditional)
4. Art. 19bis / Reynders (30% on interest component)
5. Stock exchange tax (exempt)
6. Regional inheritance tax (3-27%+ — three different systems)

Most advisors cover domains 1-3 by default. The ones that get missed: Art. 19bis interaction, regional inheritance tax, and gift tax.

The difference between good advice and complete advice isn't deeper expertise in any single domain. It's systematic coverage across all of them.
