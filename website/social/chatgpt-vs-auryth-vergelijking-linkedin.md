We asked ChatGPT and Auryth TX the same three Belgian tax questions.
The results weren't about accuracy — they were about verifiability.

Question 1 (corporate tax rate): both tools got the number right. But only one cited Art. 215 WIB 92 and flagged the conditions you'd actually need to advise a client.

Question 2 (TOB rate in 2021): ChatGPT gave 1.32% — the current rate. But 2021 was a transition year. A January transaction needed 0.12%, a June transaction 1.32%. It didn't mention the law of February 17, 2021, that split the year in half.

Question 3 (TAK 23 tax implications): ChatGPT covered 2 of 5 relevant tax domains. The three it missed — gift/inheritance tax, TOB on underlying funds, regional registration duties — are exactly where clients lose money.

Stanford researchers found general-purpose AI hallucinates in 58-88% of legal queries. Specialized tools: 17-33%. The gap isn't perfection — it's transparency.

We coined a term for this: the Verification Gap. The distance between an AI's confidence and your ability to check its claims.
