# LinkedIn post — L01: EU AI Act and legal AI

The EU AI Act is already in force. Not in the future — since 1 August 2024.

AI literacy obligations? Active since February 2025.
GPAI rules for ChatGPT/Claude? Active since August 2025.
Full enforcement with penalties up to €35M or 7% of revenue? August 2026.

But almost everything written about this regulation makes the same mistake: confusing what *providers* must do with what *deployers* must do.

If you're a Belgian tax professional using AI tools, you are a deployer. Your obligations:

→ AI literacy training for staff
→ Human oversight of AI output
→ Log retention (6 months)
→ Follow provider instructions

That's it. No conformity assessment. No quality management system. No €193K–€330K setup cost.

The cost of compliance for deployers is essentially zero — it's training, oversight, and record-keeping you should already be doing.

The real insight is not what the AI Act prohibits. It's what it *legitimises*. It creates two categories: compliant tools (source transparency, audit trails, human-in-the-loop) and non-compliant tools (black-box chatbots).

The OVB already says AI use is "neither prohibited nor mandatory."
71% of Belgian accountants view AI as an opportunity.
The regulatory framework now catches up to the profession.
