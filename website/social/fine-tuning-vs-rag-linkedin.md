Harvey AI raised $800M+ and built their legal AI on fine-tuning — training the model until it memorizes the law.

For US contract law, that makes sense. The law is relatively stable. Retraining cycles of months are acceptable.

Belgian tax law is a different beast.

Two major program laws per year. Three regions with diverging rules. A reform cycle that brought a new capital gains tax, overhauled the expat regime, restructured the investment deduction, and rewrote assessment periods — all in 2025 alone.

A model trained in January is already outdated by July. That's not a theoretical concern. It's the reality of Belgian tax practice.

The freshness test: if your law changes faster than your model retrains, fine-tuning is the wrong architecture.

That's why Auryth TX chose search-RAG fusion. When the July 2025 program law restructured the investment deduction regime, our corpus reflected the change within hours. A fine-tuned model would have needed retraining.

We wrote a deep dive comparing the two architectures on seven criteria that actually matter for legal professionals — transparency, audit trails, catastrophic forgetting, Belgian suitability, and more.
