**Subject:** 10 questions to ask before choosing a legal AI tool

Most firms start by asking "how accurate is it?" That's question 10 on our list — and it's the least useful one.

We published a checklist of 10 questions that actually determine whether a legal AI tool is safe for professional tax work. Each question comes with a specific red flag to watch for in vendor meetings.

The questions cover source provenance, citation verification, uncertainty awareness, currency, legal hierarchy, temporal queries, data handling, audit trails, export capabilities, and accuracy metrics.

It works for any tool — ours or a competitor's.
