The first question most firms ask when evaluating a legal AI tool: "how accurate is it?"

It sounds reasonable. It's also the least useful question on the list.

Here's why: a tool that's 95% accurate but can't show you which 5% is wrong is more dangerous than one that's 90% accurate and shows every source. You can manage a known risk. You can't manage a hidden one.

We wrote a 10-question checklist for evaluating any legal AI tool. Not a vendor comparison — a framework you can use in your next vendor meeting.

The questions that actually matter:

1. Where do the sources come from?
2. Can you verify every citation?
3. Does it know when it doesn't know?
4. How current is the knowledge base?
5. Does it understand legal hierarchy?
6. Can it handle temporal questions?
7. How is your data handled?
8. What happens when it's wrong?
9. Can you export for professional use?
10. Does it publish accuracy metrics?

The uncomfortable truth: 31% of lawyers are already using generative AI at work — many without their firm's knowledge. The question isn't whether your firm will use AI. It's whether you'll choose a tool that meets professional standards.
