# LinkedIn post — T07: knowledge graph

Ask a Belgian tax question and you rarely get a single article as the answer.

You get a chain.

Article 215 WIB 92 sets the corporate tax rate at 25% — but references Article 185 for transfer pricing. Article 185 was amended by the December 2023 program law. The reduced SME rate requires meeting conditions in Article 15. Withholding tax rates live in Article 269, modified by the July 2025 program law. Each provision has circulars that may narrow or expand its scope.

A keyword search finds one article. A knowledge graph navigates the entire chain.

Entities: articles, laws, rulings, concepts
Relationships: "amends", "interprets", "cites", "exception_of"
Properties: effective date, jurisdiction, authority level

When you ask "does my client qualify for the reduced SME rate?", the graph starts at Article 215, follows the reference edge to Article 15 (SME criteria), follows the amendment edge to the relevant program law, and returns the complete chain — not because the text is similar, but because the legal structure connects them.

Research shows graph-enhanced approaches exceed 85% accuracy on multi-hop reasoning tasks. Traditional RAG: 32-75%.

The difference: search finds text. A knowledge graph navigates structure.
