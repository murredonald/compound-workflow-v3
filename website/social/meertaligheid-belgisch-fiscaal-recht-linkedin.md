A tax advisor in Antwerp researches erfbelasting. Searches in Dutch. Finds Flemish court rulings, VCF provisions, administrative circulars.

Feels complete. Isn't complete.

A French-speaking chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled on the same point six months ago. Published in French. In the Pasicrisie archives. A Dutch-only search never surfaces it.

This is the structural reality of legal research in Belgium:
- Federal law: published in NL + FR (both authoritative)
- Flemish codes: Dutch only
- Walloon codes: French only
- Court rulings: procedural language only
- Advance rulings: language of application only

No single-language search covers the full Belgian legal corpus.

This isn't a nice-to-have problem. It's a half-the-corpus-missing problem. Our latest article examines why bilingualism must be an architectural foundation for any serious Belgian legal AI, not a translation feature.
