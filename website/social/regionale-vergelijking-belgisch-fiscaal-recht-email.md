# Email snippet — W04: regional comparison

**Subject:** Same inheritance, same year — double the tax. The Belgian regional problem.

**Preview text:** €7,500 in Flanders vs. €15,800 in Wallonia. Same €200,000. Same relationship.

---

Belgium has three inheritance tax regimes, three gift tax structures, and three registration duty rates. Each with different reform timelines: Flanders 2026-2029, Wallonia 2028, Brussels 2026.

A €200,000 inheritance from a parent costs ~€7,500 in Flanders or ~€15,800 in Wallonia. Every regionalized tax question is actually three questions — and the answer depends entirely on the postal code.

We mapped the full regional divergence side by side: inheritance tax, gift tax, registration duties, property tax, and reform timelines.
