# LinkedIn post — W04: regional comparison

A client in Antwerp inherits €200,000 from a parent.
Inheritance tax: ~€7,500.

Same inheritance, same relationship, same amount — but from a parent in Liège.
Inheritance tax: ~€15,800.

Same country. Same year. Double the tax.

Belgium doesn't have one inheritance tax. It has three — one per region.

And they're diverging further:
- Flanders: Phased reform 2026-2029 (already active)
- Wallonia: Major overhaul in 2028 (rates halved)
- Brussels: Incremental changes (clawback 3→5 years in 2026)

Same goes for registration duties:
- Flanders: 2% for own residence
- Wallonia: 3% with €40K abattement
- Brussels: 12.5% with €200K abattement

Every regionalized tax question is actually three questions. Three codes. Three reform timelines. Three different answers depending on the postal code.

We mapped the full divergence — inheritance, gift tax, registration duties, property tax, and reform timelines — side by side: [link]
