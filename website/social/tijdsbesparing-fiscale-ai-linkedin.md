# LinkedIn post — S04: time savings

Harvey power users save 36.9 hours per month.
Thomson Reuters claims 63% reduction in document review time.
Forrester says 2.5 hours per week for senior associates.

Impressive numbers. But they describe enterprise AI tools used by large law firms in common law jurisdictions.

Belgian tax research is a different animal.

Three regions. Two official languages. Constant legislative change. A corpus orders of magnitude smaller than US or UK case law.

So we built a conservative model specifically for Belgian tax workflow:

Without AI → ~305 min (5 hrs) per complex cross-domain question
With purpose-built AI → ~93 min (1.5 hrs)
Saving → ~3.5 hours per task

At €150/hr and one complex dossier per week: that's €1,935/month in recovered time.

Against a €99/month subscription: 20x ROI.

Even at the conservative end — 2 hrs/week at €100/hr — the return is 8.7x.

But here's what the numbers don't capture: broader coverage. Thomson Reuters found that lawyers discovered twice as many relevant cases with AI tools. In Belgian tax, that means catching the Art. 19bis interaction you didn't think to look for.

The time saving is the easiest to quantify. The coverage delta is where the real value sits.
