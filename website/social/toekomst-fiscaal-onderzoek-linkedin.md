# LinkedIn post — M01: future of tax research

AI adoption in accounting firms surged from 9% to 41% in one year.

McKinsey says 44% of legal tasks are technically automatable. The World Economic Forum lists bookkeeping among the fastest-declining roles.

But the "AI will replace lawyers" headline fundamentally misreads the data.

What the evidence actually shows:

→ AI handles: research speed, coverage completeness, change monitoring, documentation
→ Professionals handle: judgment, client relationships, ambiguous law, strategic advice

The shift is not replacement. It is restructuring.

EY launched 150+ specialized tax agents — not to eliminate professionals, but to equip 80,000 of them with better tools. The remaining roles are higher-skilled and higher-paid.

For Belgian practice specifically:
• 3 regions, 2 languages, twice-yearly program laws
• A system too complex for any individual to comprehensively track
• Exactly the environment where AI augmentation provides the most value

The firms with a clear AI strategy are 3-4× more likely to report growth.

The future of tax research is not AI replacing judgment. It is AI eliminating the friction that prevents judgment from being applied to the full scope of the question.
