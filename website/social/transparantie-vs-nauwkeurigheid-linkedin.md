The most dangerous AI isn't the one that's sometimes wrong. It's the one that never tells you when it is.

The AI industry obsesses over accuracy benchmarks. "Our tool is 95% accurate." Sounds impressive — until you realize you have no way to tell which 5% is wrong.

For Belgian tax professionals carrying full professional liability for every piece of advice, that's not a feature. That's a trap.

We coined the concept "the false certainty tax": every percentage point of accuracy you can't independently verify is a liability you can't manage.

The fix isn't higher accuracy. It's the verification stack — three layers that make AI output professionally usable:
1. Can you see the source?
2. Does the source actually say what the tool claims?
3. How strong is that source in the legal hierarchy?

Strip any layer and you're back to trusting a black box.
