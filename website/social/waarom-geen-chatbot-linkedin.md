ChatGPT trained everyone to expect a text box and a conversation. The entire legal AI industry followed. The result: professional-grade tax research crammed into an interface built for casual conversation.

Chat conversations are ephemeral. Ask the same question tomorrow, get a different answer. Try exporting a chat transcript as a client memo — you'll rewrite everything from scratch. And when a colleague asks how you reached your conclusion, "the AI told me in a chat" is not an answer.

Since mid-2023, over 300 cases of AI-generated legal hallucinations have been documented globally. Most involved professionals who treated chat output as research. It wasn't.
