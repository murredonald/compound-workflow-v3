**Preview:** Why basic RAG still hallucinates on 17–33% of legal queries, and what search-RAG fusion adds.

Most AI tools answer from memory — confidently, sometimes correctly, sometimes not. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) started to fix this by searching real documents first. But basic RAG is only the beginning.

In our latest article, we explain why vanilla RAG still fails on legal text (hierarchy, temporality, cross-references), what a search-RAG fusion architecture adds (hybrid search, authority ranking, cross-encoder reranking), and why verifiability matters more than accuracy for professional liability.
