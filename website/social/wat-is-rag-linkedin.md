Every AI answer without a source citation is an opinion disguised as research. That's not a hot take — it's the reality of how most AI tools work today.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) started to fix this. But basic RAG — dump documents into a vector database, connect a language model, done — still hallucinates on 17–33% of legal queries. Stanford proved it.

The real question isn't "RAG or no RAG." It's what happens *before* the language model ever sees a document. Search-RAG fusion layers professional search infrastructure — hybrid search, authority ranking, cross-encoder reranking — before generation even begins.

Most RAG explainers focus on accuracy. They're missing the point. The real advantage isn't that RAG is more accurate — it's that it's verifiable. A tool that's 90% accurate and shows its sources is safer than one that's 95% accurate and gives you no way to check.

For Belgian tax professionals, your professional liability doesn't depend on the tool's accuracy. It depends on whether you verified the advice you gave your client.

We call this the verifiability principle. And it's why Auryth TX fuses search infrastructure with RAG — not one or the other.
