Harvey: $8 billion valuation. 100,000 lawyers in 60 countries.
Blue J: $133 million raised. 90%+ prediction accuracy.
Legora: $1.8 billion. 40+ countries in under a year.

None of them can tell you whether erfbelasting in Brussels is calculated differently from Flanders.

Not because they're bad products — they're excellent. But they optimize for large, English-speaking jurisdictions. Belgium's 12,000+ tax professionals, two languages, and three regional tax codes will never be a priority market for a company targeting $100M+ annual revenue.

Our latest article breaks down what each does well, where they fall short for Belgian practice, and what it means for practitioners here.

Key finding: it's the transparency gap that matters most. None of these tools systematically surface source contradictions, rank by legal hierarchy, or flag when the administrative position diverges from case law.
