## What Is the TOB?

The Taks op Beursverrichtingen (TOB), or tax on stock exchange transactions, is a Belgian levy applied when securities are bought, sold, or redeemed through a financial intermediary. It affects both individuals and organisations operating through Belgian-based accounts.

## Key Rates at a Glance

TOB rates vary depending on the type of security:

- **Shares and similar instruments**: 0.35% (capped)
- **Bonds and debt securities**: 0.12% (capped)
- **Accumulation fund units**: 1.32% (capped)

Each category has a maximum amount per transaction. Rates and caps are subject to legislative updates.

## Common Questions

**Who is responsible for payment?** The financial intermediary typically withholds the TOB. For transactions through foreign brokers, Belgian tax residents may need to self-declare and pay directly.

**Are there exemptions?** Certain institutional investors and specific transaction types may qualify for reduced rates or exemptions. The details depend on the investor's status and the nature of the security.

## Staying Current

TOB rates and thresholds can change with each budget cycle. Tracking these changes manually across multiple sources is time-consuming and error-prone.
