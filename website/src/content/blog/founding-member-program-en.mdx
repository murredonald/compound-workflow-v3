## Why Founding Members Matter

Building a tax research tool that truly serves Belgian professionals requires close collaboration with the people who will use it daily. That is why we created the Founding Member Program.

As a founding member, you get more than early access. You get a permanent seat at the table — influencing which features we prioritise, which jurisdictions we expand into, and how the product evolves.

## What You Get

- **Permanent pricing lock**: Founding members pay significantly less than standard rates — for as long as their subscription remains active
- **Early access**: Be among the first to use new features and capabilities
- **Direct input**: Regular feedback sessions with our product team
- **Priority support**: Dedicated support channel for founding members

## How It Works

1. **Join the waitlist** — Sign up with your email to reserve your spot
2. **Select your tier** — Choose the plan that fits your practice (Solo, Team, or Firm)
3. **Lock in your rate** — Your founding member price is guaranteed for life

## Limited Availability

The Founding Member Program is capped at a fixed number of seats per tier. Once filled, standard pricing applies for new subscribers.

This is not a promotional discount — it is a long-term partnership between Auryth and the professionals who help build the product they need.
