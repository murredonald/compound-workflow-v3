## Definition

Conformity assessment is a structured procedure to verify and document that a system meets specified requirements. Under the EU AI Act, high-risk AI systems typically require conformity assessment steps supported by technical documentation and testing evidence.

## Why it matters

- **Market access**: conformity is tied to lawful placing on the EU market for certain systems.
- **Audit readiness**: assessment produces the evidence regulators and customers ask for.
- **Quality discipline**: it forces clear scope, intended use, and controls.

## How it works

```
Define scope -> implement controls -> test -> document -> assess -> maintain after changes
```

Assessment routes and standards vary by system category and applicable rules, so the process must be designed for the specific intended use.

## Practical example

A provider prepares the technical documentation, runs validation tests, and documents risk controls for a system classified as high-risk, before releasing it to customers.

## Common questions

**Q: Is conformity assessment a one-time event?**

A: No. Material changes, new risks, or updated standards may require reassessment and updated documentation.

**Q: Who is responsible for the assessment?**

A: Usually the provider, but deployers still need to ensure proper use and operational controls.
