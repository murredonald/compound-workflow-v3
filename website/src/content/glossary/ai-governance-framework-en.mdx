## Definition

An AI governance framework defines how an organization makes decisions about AI: who owns the system, who approves changes, what rules apply, and how risks and incidents are handled. It turns "Responsible AI" into concrete processes.

## Why it matters

- **Clear ownership** prevents unmanaged models and shadow deployments.
- **Repeatable approvals** reduce compliance and operational risk.
- **Auditability** makes it possible to prove what happened, when, and why.

## How it works

```
Policies -> roles (RACI) -> controls -> documentation -> monitoring -> incident response
```

Common elements include: an AI inventory, acceptable-use rules, vendor due diligence, change management, and a review board for high-impact use cases.

## Practical example

A tax advisory firm maintains a registry of AI tools used in client work, defines when human review is mandatory, and requires documented testing before any model update goes live.

## Common questions

**Q: What is the minimum viable governance?**

A: Inventory, ownership, intended use, approval process, monitoring, and an incident playbook.

**Q: Does governance slow down delivery?**

A: It can, if it’s bureaucratic. Good governance is lightweight and risk-based: higher-risk systems get more controls.
