## Definition

Algorithmic transparency is the practice of making an AI system understandable enough for the people who rely on it. It typically includes: intended purpose, data sources, model limitations, evaluation results, and how users can interpret outputs safely.

## Why it matters

- **Trust**: users need to know when to rely on the system and when not to.
- **Safety**: transparency helps users spot errors and misuse.
- **Compliance**: many frameworks require documentation and user information.

## How it works

```
Document -> disclose -> explain outputs -> log decisions -> keep docs updated
```

Transparency is not "reveal the source code". It is the right level of disclosure for the audience: users, auditors, and internal owners.

## Practical example

A legal AI tool explains which sources it searched, shows citations, and clarifies that it is a research assistant — not a substitute for professional judgment.

## Common questions

**Q: Is transparency the same as explainable AI ([XAI](/en/glossary/explainability/))?**

A: XAI is one technique. Transparency is broader: disclosures, documentation, and operational clarity.

**Q: Can we be transparent without exposing trade secrets?**

A: Often yes. You can disclose intended use, limitations, and controls without revealing proprietary implementation details.
