## Definition

Boolean search is a way of expressing exact constraints using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT (often combined with parentheses and quotes). It is commonly used in full-text systems to increase precision and reduce noise.

## Why it matters

- **Precision**: exclude common false positives (e.g., "tax credit" NOT "VAT").
- **Auditability**: the query clearly describes why a document matches.
- **Power users**: legal and research users often expect Boolean control.
- **Deterministic behavior**: helpful when you need repeatable results.

## How it works

```
(termA AND termB) OR ("exact phrase") AND NOT termC
```

Operator support varies by engine (case sensitivity, default operators, phrase rules), so query understanding and documentation matter.

## Practical example

`("withholding tax" OR "dividend tax") AND Belgium AND NOT "US treaty"` can narrow results to the exact jurisdiction and topic, excluding an unwanted subtopic.

## Common questions

**Q: Does Boolean search replace ranking?**

A: No. Boolean logic selects a candidate set; ranking still decides which candidates appear first.

**Q: Why do my operators behave unexpectedly?**

A: Many engines apply implicit operators, stopword removal, or special parsing rules. Consistent query parsing is part of good query understanding.
