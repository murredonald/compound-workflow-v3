## Definition

Compliance-aware retrieval is a retrieval design where legal, privacy, and governance requirements are enforced *before* and *during* retrieval and [citation](/en/glossary/citation/). Instead of "retrieve everything and hope the answer is safe", the system uses policies to control what can be retrieved, shown, cited, or logged.

## Why it matters

- **Regulatory exposure**: retrieving the wrong data can be a compliance incident even if the final answer is correct.
- **Audit readiness**: policies and logs make behavior reviewable.
- **Data ethics**: supports minimization, purpose limitation, and [provenance](/en/glossary/source-provenance/) discipline.
- **Trust**: users can see that sources are curated, permitted, and traceable.

## How it works

Compliance-aware retrieval typically adds a policy layer to the [retrieval pipeline](/en/glossary/retrieval-pipeline/):

```
Query -> policy checks -> retrieve allowed sources -> rank -> cite -> log for audit
```

Common controls include:

- Access control ([role-based permissions](/en/glossary/role-based-access-control/), tenant boundaries)
- Allowlists/denylists for sources and domains
- Jurisdiction and language constraints
- PII and sensitive-data filters (what can be retrieved or displayed)
- Mandatory citation and provenance requirements
- Logging and retention rules for evidence

## Practical example

A user asks a question that could trigger retrieval of internal client documents. Compliance-aware retrieval restricts retrieval to approved public sources (law, official guidance), logs the decision, and prevents the system from citing or exposing restricted materials.

## Common questions

**Q: Isn’t this just a security feature?**

A: It overlaps with security, but it is broader: it’s about meeting legal and governance obligations (what sources you can use, what you must log, and what you must disclose).

**Q: Does it reduce answer quality?**

A: It can reduce recall if policies are overly strict. The goal is to balance usefulness with defensibility, and make constraints explicit.
