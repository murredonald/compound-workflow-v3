## Definition

Content discoverability describes whether content can be reliably found and indexed. It includes technical accessibility (crawl/index rules), information architecture (URLs, internal links), and the metadata that helps search understand what a page is about.

## Why it matters

- **No indexing, no results**: content that can’t be discovered can’t rank.
- **Authority building**: strong internal linking and structure improve topical coverage.
- **Faster updates**: good discoverability helps new or changed content appear quickly.
- **Lower maintenance**: clear patterns reduce fragile, manual indexing work.

## How it works

```
Link structure + access + metadata -> discovery -> indexing -> retrieval
```

For public sites, this overlaps with SEO. For internal [knowledge bases](/en/glossary/knowledge-base/), it overlaps with permissions, navigation, and content governance.

## Practical example

A glossary page that is linked from the glossary index, has consistent URLs, and includes a short definition in structured fields is easier to discover and index than an orphaned page with no links.

## Common questions

**Q: Is discoverability only about Google?**

A: No. Internal search also needs stable URLs, consistent structure, and indexable content sources.

**Q: What should I measure first?**

A: Track zero-result searches, pages with no inbound links, and indexing coverage gaps using search analytics.
