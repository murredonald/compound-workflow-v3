## Definition

Data ethics covers the norms and decisions around data that go beyond pure technical possibility. It includes purpose limitation, data minimization, quality, [provenance](/en/glossary/source-provenance/), access control, and how data impacts people when used in AI systems.

## Why it matters

- **Trust**: clients and users expect careful handling of sensitive information.
- **Quality**: bad data produces bad models and misleading outputs.
- **Risk**: unethical data practices create legal, security, and reputational problems.

## How it works

```
Purpose -> minimize -> secure -> document -> monitor -> correct
```

Practical controls include [data governance](/en/glossary/data-governance/), retention rules, [access management](/en/glossary/access-control/), and documentation of sources and consent where relevant.

## Practical example

A professional services tool keeps client data separated by matter, logs access, and avoids training general models on sensitive client documents without explicit governance approval.

## Common questions

**Q: Is data ethics the same as privacy law?**

A: No. Privacy law is a baseline. Data ethics also covers legitimacy, expectations, and potential harm.

**Q: Can ethical data use still be high-performance?**

A: Yes. Strong governance and clean data often improve reliability and reduce downstream risk.
