## Definition

The EU AI Act is an EU regulation that governs AI systems using a risk-based approach. It defines prohibited practices, special obligations for certain uses (especially high-risk systems), and transparency requirements for some AI interactions.

## Why it matters

- **Compliance**: it can impose concrete requirements on how AI systems are built and used.
- **Contracts and procurement**: vendors and clients will ask for evidence (documentation, controls).
- **Operational impact**: governance, oversight, and monitoring become mandatory for some systems.

## How it works

```
Identify role + classify system risk -> apply requirements -> document -> monitor
```

Practical steps usually include: define intended purpose, determine whether a system falls into a regulated category, implement risk controls, and maintain the required documentation and logs.

## Practical example

An AI tool used in a regulated workflow is assessed for whether it qualifies as high-risk. If so, the provider prepares documentation and completes conformity steps, and deployers ensure human oversight and proper use.

## Common questions

**Q: Does the EU AI Act apply to every AI tool?**

A: No. Obligations depend on the type of system, intended use, role (provider/deployer), and risk classification.

**Q: Is this only a provider problem?**

A: Not always. Deployers can have obligations too, especially for high-risk systems and certain operational controls.
