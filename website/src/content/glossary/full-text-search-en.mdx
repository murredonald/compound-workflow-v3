## Definition

Full-text search is keyword-based retrieval over text fields such as titles, body text, and metadata. Most systems build an **[inverted index](/en/glossary/inverted-index/)** that maps terms to the documents (and positions) where they occur, enabling fast lookups and scoring.

## Why it matters

- **Precision**: exact terms, phrases, and filters are often critical in legal and tax content.
- **Speed**: inverted indexes scale well to large corpora.
- **Transparency**: you can explain why a result matched (terms, fields, boosts).
- **Control**: supports field weighting, phrase matching, and Boolean operators.

## How it works

```
Text -> tokenize/normalize -> inverted index -> query -> scoring -> ranked results
```

## Practical example

Searching for `"withholding tax" AND Belgium` can reliably surface documents that explicitly contain that phrase and jurisdiction, even when semantic models would drift.

## Common questions

**Q: Is full-text search the same as [semantic search](/en/glossary/semantic-search/)?**

A: No. Full-text search matches tokens/phrases. Semantic search matches meaning (often via embeddings). Many systems combine both ([hybrid search](/en/glossary/hybrid-search/)).

**Q: Why do I sometimes miss results that "should" match?**

A: Common causes are analyzer choices (stemming, stopwords), missing fields, or content that was not indexed due to the indexing strategy.
