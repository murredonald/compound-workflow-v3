## Definition

A high-risk AI system is a system that falls into a category defined by the EU AI Act as high-risk, typically because its intended use can significantly affect people’s rights, safety, or access to essential services.

## Why it matters

- **More obligations**: high-risk classification triggers stricter requirements.
- **Operational controls**: risk management, documentation, and oversight become central.
- **Enforcement**: penalties and audits focus on high-impact uses.

## How it works

```
Define intended use -> check AI Act categories -> implement controls -> document -> assess conformity
```

The exact obligations depend on role (provider vs deployer) and the specific high-risk category.

## Practical example

An AI system used to support decisions in a regulated process is treated as potentially high-risk. The organization implements human oversight, logging, and documentation before relying on it in production.

## Common questions

**Q: Does "high-risk" mean the model is unsafe?**

A: Not necessarily. It’s a legal classification based on use case and impact, not a statement about model quality.

**Q: Can a general-purpose model become high-risk?**

A: It depends on how it’s used and integrated. Intended use and deployment context matter.
