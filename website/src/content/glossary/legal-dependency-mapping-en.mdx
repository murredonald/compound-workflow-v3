## Definition

Legal dependency mapping is the process of extracting and modeling relationships between legal sources: citations, cross-[references](/en/glossary/citation/), amendments, implementing measures, and hierarchical links. The result is often a graph that helps systems understand how texts connect and which sources control or override others.

## Why it matters

- **Better retrieval**: a [query](/en/glossary/prompt/) about one article often requires linked definitions or implementing rules.
- **Impact analysis**: when a source changes, dependencies show what might be affected.
- **[Explainability](/en/glossary/algorithmic-transparency/)**: lets users see why a source is relevant (it is cited by / cites / implements).
- **Conflict handling**: helps detect contradictory or superseded sources.

## How it works

Dependency mapping typically combines citation extraction with normalization:

```
Parse documents -> extract references -> normalize identifiers -> build graph -> use in retrieval and UI
```

Common relationship types:

- "cites" / "is cited by"
- "amends" / "is amended by"
- "implements" / "is implemented by"
- "defines" / "is defined in"

## Practical example

A user queries a tax article. The system also retrieves the definition article it depends on, the implementing decree, and the latest amendment. The answer includes citations and a short "dependency path" to justify why those sources were included.

## Common questions

**Q: Is this the same as a knowledge graph?**

A: It can be part of a knowledge graph, but dependency mapping is narrower: it focuses on document-to-document relationships and legal references that affect applicability.

**Q: Do you need perfect extraction?**

A: No. Even partial graphs add value, as long as references are normalized and the system is clear about confidence.
