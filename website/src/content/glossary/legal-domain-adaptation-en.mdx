## Definition

Legal [domain adaptation](/en/glossary/fine-tuning/) is the process of adapting an AI system (LLM, classifier, or retrieval stack) to legal texts and workflows. It focuses on handling legal terminology, [citations](/en/glossary/citation/), document structure, and domain-specific notions of correctness (e.g., jurisdiction, temporal validity, and hierarchy of authority).

## Why it matters

- **Precision**: legal language is dense, context-dependent, and sensitive to small wording differences.
- **[Grounding](/en/glossary/grounding/)**: legal work requires answers tied to authoritative sources, not generic knowledge.
- **Lower error cost**: small mistakes can have large compliance and liability impact.
- **Better retrieval + generation**: improves both what is found and how it is summarized.

## How it works

Domain adaptation usually combines data, retrieval, and evaluation changes:

```
Legal sources + labels -> adapt retrieval + prompts + evaluation -> deploy -> monitor errors
```

Common techniques include: curating authoritative corpora, adding legal metadata (jurisdiction, in-force dates), building authority-aware ranking, using legal-specific evaluation sets, and refining prompts for citation-first answers.

## Practical example

A generic assistant might treat "circular" and "law" as similar. A legally adapted system recognizes that a circular is typically non-binding guidance, boosts the binding legal text, and formats the output with citations and applicability constraints.

## Common questions

**Q: Is this the same as fine-tuning?**

A: Not necessarily. Fine-tuning is one possible tool. Legal domain adaptation can also be achieved with better retrieval, authority ranking, prompt design, and evaluation without changing model weights.

**Q: What is the biggest failure mode?**

A: Treating legal correctness as "sounds right". Legal systems require temporal and jurisdictional checks and careful source selection.
