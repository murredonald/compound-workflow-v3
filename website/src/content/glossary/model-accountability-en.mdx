## Definition

Model accountability means you can answer, with evidence: who owns the model, what it is allowed to do, what data it uses, how it was tested, when it changed, and who approved those changes. It is a governance property, not a technical [metric](/en/glossary/distance-metric/).

## Why it matters

- **Professional responsibility**: users need to justify advice supported by AI.
- **Incident response**: when something goes wrong, accountability enables fast root-cause analysis.
- **Regulatory readiness**: documentation and traceability are recurring obligations.

## How it works

```
Owner + intended use + versioning + testing + approvals + logs -> accountability
```

Typical artifacts include: a model inventory entry, evaluation results, release notes, and an [audit trail](/en/glossary/audit-trail/) of key decisions.

## Practical example

If a model update changes retrieval or ranking behavior, the change is logged, validated against a test set, and approved by a named owner before deployment.

## Common questions

**Q: Is accountability the same as legal liability?**

A: No. Accountability is about governance and evidence. Liability is a legal outcome that depends on contracts and law.

**Q: Does accountability require full transparency?**

A: Not necessarily. You can be accountable with well-scoped disclosures, internal documentation, and clear controls.
