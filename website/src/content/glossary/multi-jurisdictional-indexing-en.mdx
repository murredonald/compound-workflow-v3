## Definition

Multi-jurisdictional indexing is the design of an index and metadata model that supports searching across multiple jurisdictions (countries, regions, legal systems) without mixing results in a way that misleads users. It makes jurisdiction an explicit retrieval and ranking signal, not an afterthought.

## Why it matters

- **Applicability**: the "right" rule depends on jurisdiction and sometimes on sub-region.
- **Language variation**: the same concept can appear in different languages and citation styles.
- **Authority differences**: courts and administrative bodies have different weights per jurisdiction.
- **Better UX**: enables clean filters, routing, and result grouping by jurisdiction.

## How it works

Most implementations combine metadata, routing, and ranking:

```
Query -> detect jurisdiction signals -> route/search -> rank with authority -> present with clear labels
```

Common building blocks:

- Mandatory metadata (jurisdiction, effective dates, source type, issuing body)
- Separate indexes or partitions per jurisdiction (or per language) when needed
- [Query](/en/glossary/prompt/) understanding rules for jurisdiction hints ("BE", "NL", treaty names, local abbreviations)
- Cross-lingual expansion for shared concepts and citations

## Practical example

A query like "withholding tax dividend" may apply differently in Belgium and the Netherlands. A multi-jurisdictional index routes or filters results based on detected jurisdiction intent and clearly [labels](/en/glossary/ground-truth/) results when multiple jurisdictions are plausible.

## Common questions

**Q: Do you always need separate indexes per jurisdiction?**

A: Not always. Many stacks use one index with strong metadata and filters. Separate partitions help when languages, schemas, or authority models differ significantly.

**Q: What is the biggest risk?**

A: Showing a correct rule for the *wrong jurisdiction* without making that clear.
