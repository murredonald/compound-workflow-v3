## Definition

Query intent is the purpose behind a query: what the user wants to find or do. [Search systems](/en/glossary/information-retrieval-system/) use intent signals to decide which result types to show, which fields to weight, and how to rank candidates.

## Why it matters

- **Better relevance**: the same words can mean different things depending on intent.
- **Correct result type**: intent can shift results toward definitions, documents, filters, or actions.
- **Fewer zero-result searches**: understanding intent enables safer expansions and fallbacks.
- **Measurable improvement**: intent segments make analytics and tuning more precise.

## How it works

```
Query -> signals (terms, entities, history) -> intent guess -> ranking strategy
```

Common intent groupings include informational, navigational, and transactional. In domain search (legal/tax), intent can be "find the source", "understand meaning", or "compare versions".

## Practical example

If a user searches "Article 26 [WIB92](/en/glossary/wib-cir/)", the likely intent is **source lookup**. A good system ranks the exact article page above commentary, and offers filters like date/version.

## Common questions

**Q: Is intent the same as [query](/en/glossary/prompt/) understanding?**

A: No. Query understanding interprets the text (entities, language, ambiguity). Intent is the goal inferred from that understanding.

**Q: Can a query have multiple intents?**

A: Yes. Some queries are ambiguous; systems often hedge by mixing result types or prompting the user to refine.
