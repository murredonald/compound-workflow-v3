## Definition

Query understanding is the set of techniques a search system uses to interpret what a query means. It covers parsing, language detection, spelling normalization, [entity recognition](/en/glossary/entity-extraction/), and disambiguation so retrieval can match meaning, not just keywords.

## Why it matters

- **Less ambiguity**: "CIR 92" and "CIR 1992" should resolve to the same concept.
- **Better matching**: entity-aware search finds the right documents even with short queries.
- **Safer expansion**: understanding prevents "helpful" expansions that change intent.
- **Better UX**: enables suggestions, filters, and result grouping.

## How it works

```
Query -> normalize -> extract entities -> resolve ambiguity -> build retrieval query
```

The output is typically a structured representation (tokens, entities, intent, filters) used by the ranking pipeline.

## Practical example

A user types "VAT deadline Belgium Q4". Good query understanding detects the jurisdiction (Belgium), the topic (VAT), and the period (Q4) and boosts authoritative guidance for the correct filing period.

## Common questions

**Q: Is query understanding only for semantic/vector search?**

A: No. Even classic full-text systems benefit from normalization, synonyms, and [entity extraction](/en/glossary/ner/).

**Q: How do you measure improvements?**

A: Use [search analytics](/en/glossary/search-analytics/) to track zero-result rate, reformulations, click satisfaction, and offline relevance judgments.
