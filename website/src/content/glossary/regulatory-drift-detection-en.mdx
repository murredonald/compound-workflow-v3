## Definition

Regulatory drift detection is the practice of identifying when relevant laws, regulations, administrative guidance, or internal policies change in a way that affects an AI system. In legal and tax settings, "drift" often means that a previously correct answer, [citation](/en/glossary/citation/), or workflow is no longer valid because the underlying source changed.

## Why it matters

- **Currency**: legal obligations can change faster than models and content pipelines.
- **Risk control**: drift can silently create compliance exposure if not detected.
- **Traceability**: supports documentation of when and why the system was updated.
- **Operational discipline**: turns "stay up to date" into a measurable process.

## How it works

Typical drift detection combines source monitoring with downstream triggers:

```
Monitor authoritative sources -> detect changes -> classify impact -> update index/prompts -> document + review
```

Detection signals can include: new versions of legal texts, amendments, repeal dates, new circulars, court decisions that change interpretation, or updated internal policies that constrain retrieval and disclosure.

## Practical example

A tax rate or reporting threshold changes on an official site. Drift detection flags the change, triggers re-indexing of the updated text, and creates a review task for any FAQ answers that cite the old rule.

## Common questions

**Q: Is this the same as [model drift](/en/glossary/model-drift/)?**

A: No. Model drift is about changes in data distributions or performance. Regulatory drift is about changes in the *rules* the system must follow and cite.

**Q: What should happen when drift is detected?**

A: At minimum: update sources, re-run retrieval and answer evaluations on affected topics, and record the change in documentation/logs.
