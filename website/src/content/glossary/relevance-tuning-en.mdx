## Definition

Relevance tuning is the practice of improving how a search engine ranks results for real user queries. It includes adjusting field weights, boosting trusted sources, refining analyzers and synonyms, and validating changes with offline judgments and online analytics.

## Why it matters

- **User trust**: small ranking errors can break confidence in high-stakes domains.
- **Consistency**: reduces "random-feeling" results across similar queries.
- **Business impact**: better relevance improves conversions and reduces support load.
- **Safety**: tuning can prefer authoritative sources and reduce risky matches.

## How it works

```
Measure -> hypothesize -> adjust ranking -> evaluate -> deploy -> monitor
```

Good tuning starts with clear success metrics (time-to-result, satisfaction, task completion) and a representative query set.

## Practical example

If users searching "[WIB92](/en/glossary/wib-cir/) article 26" often click the official text, you can boost pages with official [citations](/en/glossary/citation/) and demote generic commentary for that intent.

## Common questions

**Q: Should we tune with rules or [machine learning](/en/glossary/machine-learning/)?**

A: Both can work. Rules are transparent and fast to iterate; ML can capture complex patterns but needs data and careful evaluation.

**Q: What’s the fastest way to find tuning opportunities?**

A: Look at search analytics for zero-result queries, high reformulation rates, and queries with low click satisfaction.
