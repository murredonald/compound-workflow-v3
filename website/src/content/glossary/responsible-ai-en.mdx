## Definition

Responsible AI is a set of principles and operational practices that ensure an AI system is built and used in a way that is safe, compliant, and worthy of user trust. It is not a single feature; it is governance across the full lifecycle (design, data, training, deployment, monitoring, and retirement).

## Why it matters

- **Trust**: professionals adopt AI only when they can justify and defend its outputs.
- **Compliance**: regulations (like the EU AI Act) require concrete controls, not marketing claims.
- **Risk**: AI failures often come from process gaps (no oversight, weak documentation, no monitoring).

## How it works

```
Governance + risk management + oversight + transparency + data discipline -> responsible outcomes
```

In practice this means: clear ownership, documented intended use, risk controls, monitoring, and the ability for humans to intervene.

## Practical example

A legal research assistant is designed so that every answer is grounded in sources, uncertainty is surfaced, and a professional must review before advice is sent to a client.

## Common questions

**Q: Is Responsible AI the same as "AI ethics"?**

A: Ethics is part of it. Responsible AI also includes operational controls: monitoring, documentation, accountability, and compliance.

**Q: Who is responsible: the vendor or the user?**

A: Usually both. Providers and deployers have different responsibilities, and governance should make those boundaries explicit.
