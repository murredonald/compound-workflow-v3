## Definition

Search analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing search behavior and outcomes. It turns search from a black box into an improvable system by showing what users search for, what they click, and where they struggle.

## Why it matters

- **Find gaps**: identify zero-result queries and missing content.
- **Tune ranking**: measure whether changes improve satisfaction.
- **Validate intent**: see which intents succeed and which fail.
- **Improve discoverability**: detect content that is hard to find or not indexed.

## How it works

```
Log queries + results + clicks -> metrics -> insights -> experiments -> iteration
```

Common [metrics](/en/glossary/distance-metric/) include: query volume, zero-result rate, click-through rate, time-to-first-click, reformulation rate, and conversions (task completion).

## Practical example

If "inheritance tax Belgium spouse" has high volume but low clicks and many reformulations, that’s a signal to adjust relevance tuning, add [semantic expansion](/en/glossary/semantic-expansion/), or create better content.

## Common questions

**Q: What’s the minimum analytics to start with?**

A: Queries, result count, clicked result, and whether the user reformulated or abandoned.

**Q: Can analytics be privacy-safe?**

A: Yes. Use aggregation, hashing, retention limits, and avoid logging sensitive raw content when possible.
