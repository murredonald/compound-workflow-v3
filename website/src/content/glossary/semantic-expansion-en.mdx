## Definition

Semantic expansion (often called [query expansion](/en/glossary/query-expansion/)) adds meaning-aware alternatives to a query, such as synonyms, related concepts, or entity variants. The goal is to retrieve relevant items that do not contain the exact words the user typed.

## Why it matters

- **Higher recall**: captures wording variation across documents and languages.
- **Better domain coverage**: maps abbreviations, citations, and jargon to standard forms.
- **Improved user experience**: fewer "no results" searches and fewer reformulations.
- **Works with hybrid search**: expansion can feed both full-text and [vector retrieval](/en/glossary/dense-retrieval/).

## How it works

```
Query -> understand meaning -> expand safely -> retrieve -> rank -> validate with analytics
```

Expansion sources include curated synonym lists, taxonomies, and embedding-based nearest neighbors. The hard part is avoiding expansions that change intent.

## Practical example

If users search "CIR92", expansion can include "WIB92" and "[Code des impôts sur les revenus](/en/glossary/wib-cir/)" so the same legal source is found across language variants.

## Common questions

**Q: Why can expansion hurt relevance?**

A: Over-expansion adds noise. Good systems expand selectively, weight expansions lower, and monitor outcomes.

**Q: Is this the same as synonyms in the index?**

A: Related, but not identical. You can expand at query time, at index time, or both. Query-time expansion is usually easier to audit and adjust.
