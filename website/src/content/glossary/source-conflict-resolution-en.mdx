## Definition

Source conflict resolution is the set of rules and workflows a retrieval or [RAG](/en/glossary/rag/) system uses when relevant sources disagree. In legal settings, conflicts can be real (different rules across time or jurisdictions) or apparent (different interpretations, missing context, or superseded versions).

## Why it matters

- **Correctness**: legal answers must follow controlling authority and applicability.
- **Safety**: hiding conflicts can create false certainty and compliance risk.
- **Trust**: users value transparency when sources do not align.
- **Better triage**: routes genuinely ambiguous cases to human review.

## How it works

Conflict resolution is usually a combination of detection + policy:

```
Retrieve -> detect conflicts -> apply hierarchy + applicability -> present outcome + citations -> escalate if ambiguous
```

Common strategies:

- Prefer sources with higher authority and clearer applicability (jurisdiction, dates)
- Distinguish "superseded" vs "co-existing" rules (e.g., different periods)
- Show both positions with explicit conditions, not a single blended statement
- Require human oversight for high-impact or unresolved conflicts

## Practical example

Two sources state different withholding tax rates. Investigation shows one applies before an amendment date. The system highlights the effective dates, cites both versions, and uses the in-force text for the requested period.

## Common questions

**Q: Can an [LLM](/en/glossary/llm/) resolve conflicts by itself?**

A: It can summarize and compare, but the system should enforce authority/applicability policies and escalate when uncertainty remains.

**Q: Should conflicts always be shown to users?**

A: For legal and tax, it is usually safer to show conflicts (or at least signal uncertainty) rather than hiding them behind a single confident answer.
