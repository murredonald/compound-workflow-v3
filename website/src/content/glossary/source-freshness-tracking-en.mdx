## Definition

Source freshness tracking is the practice of storing and using "currency" metadata for each document in an index: last updated time, publication date, effective (in-force) dates, and version identifiers. It helps a retrieval system prefer the most current applicable sources and flag potentially outdated material.

## Why it matters

- **Legal change is constant**: tax and regulatory rules evolve through amendments and guidance.
- **Fewer outdated [citations](/en/glossary/citation/)**: reduces answers that cite superseded versions.
- **Better ranking**: freshness can be a useful tie-breaker among similarly relevant sources.
- **Operational monitoring**: enables alerts for sources that have not been refreshed.

## How it works

Freshness tracking is usually implemented as metadata + scoring rules:

```
Ingest -> extract dates/versions -> store freshness fields -> rank with freshness -> alert on staleness
```

Common fields:

- `published_at`, `updated_at`
- `effective_from`, `effective_to` (or repeal date)
- `version_id` / consolidation identifiers
- `last_checked_at` (when the crawler verified the source)

## Practical example

If a consolidated legal article was updated last month, the system boosts it above an older PDF excerpt. If a source has not been checked for a long time, it is flagged for review or down-weighted.

## Common questions

**Q: Is freshness always good for ranking?**

A: Not always. Freshness matters only when the newer source is applicable. Authority and applicability still come first.

**Q: How do you prevent "new but irrelevant" boosting?**

A: Use freshness as a secondary signal and require strong relevance + applicability filters.
