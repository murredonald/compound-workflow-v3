## Definition

Vector embeddings are numerical arrays (vectors) that represent the meaning of text, images, or other data in a high-dimensional space. Each dimension captures some aspect of the input's semantics, and the geometric relationships between vectors — their distances and angles — encode similarity. Two texts with similar meaning produce vectors that are close together; unrelated texts produce vectors that are far apart.

## Why it matters

- **Foundation of semantic search** — vector embeddings enable retrieval based on meaning rather than keyword matching, which is essential when legal terminology varies across languages and contexts
- **Multilingual capability** — cross-lingual embedding models map Dutch, French, and German text into the same vector space, enabling a query in one language to retrieve documents in another
- **Scalable similarity** — once embedded, millions of documents can be compared efficiently using approximate nearest-neighbour algorithms, returning results in milliseconds
- **Downstream flexibility** — the same embeddings can power search, clustering, deduplication, classification, and anomaly detection

## How it works

An embedding model (typically a transformer-based neural network) processes an input text and produces a fixed-length vector, commonly ranging from 384 to 1536 dimensions. During training, the model learns to map semantically similar inputs to nearby points and dissimilar inputs to distant points.

At retrieval time, both the user's query and all documents in the corpus are represented as vectors. The system finds documents whose vectors are closest to the query vector using a distance metric — usually cosine similarity or dot product. This computation is made efficient at scale through specialised vector indexes (HNSW, IVF) stored in vector databases.

The quality of vector embeddings depends heavily on the model used. General-purpose models work broadly but may underperform on specialised domains. Fine-tuning on domain-specific text pairs — for instance, tax queries matched to relevant legislation — can substantially improve relevance for legal and tax applications.

## Common questions

**Q: How are vector embeddings different from traditional TF-IDF vectors?**

A: TF-IDF vectors are sparse (mostly zeros) and based on word frequency statistics — they cannot capture synonyms or meaning. Vector embeddings are dense (every dimension has a value) and learned from large text datasets, capturing semantic relationships. "Corporate tax" and "vennootschapsbelasting" would have very different TF-IDF vectors but similar dense embeddings.

**Q: How many dimensions do vector embeddings typically have?**

A: Common sizes are 384 (smaller, faster models), 768 (BERT-class), and 1536 (larger models like OpenAI's ada-002). More dimensions can capture finer distinctions but require more storage and compute. For most legal retrieval tasks, 768-dimensional embeddings provide a good balance.

**Q: Do vector embeddings need to be recomputed when the model changes?**

A: Yes. Each embedding model defines its own vector space. If you switch models or update to a newer version, all documents must be re-embedded. This is why model selection is an important architectural decision — re-embedding a large corpus is computationally expensive.
