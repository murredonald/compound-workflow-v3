## What is WIB/CIR?

The **WIB/CIR** (Wetboek van de Inkomstenbelastingen / Code des Impôts sur les Revenus) is Belgium's primary income tax legislation. Often referred to as WIB92 or CIR92 (reflecting the 1992 consolidation), it governs:

- Personal income tax (personenbelasting / impôt des personnes physiques)
- Corporate income tax (vennootschapsbelasting / impôt des sociétés)
- Legal entities tax (rechtspersonenbelasting / impôt des personnes morales)
- Non-resident income tax (belasting niet-inwoners / impôt des non-résidents)

## Structure

The code is organized into titles covering:

1. **Title I** — General provisions and definitions
2. **Title II** — Personal income tax
3. **Title III** — Corporate income tax
4. **Title IV** — Legal entities tax
5. **Title V** — Non-resident tax
6. **Title VI** — Common provisions (deductions, rates, procedures)

## Bilingual nature

As with most Belgian federal legislation, the WIB/CIR exists in both Dutch (WIB) and French (CIR) versions. Both have equal legal force. The code is regularly updated through tax reform packages and annual budget laws.

## Why it matters

For any Belgian tax question, the WIB/CIR is typically the starting point. Understanding article references (e.g., "Art. 26 WIB92") is essential for tax professionals working with Belgian clients.
