## Overview of Belgian Corporate Income Tax

Belgian corporate income tax (vennootschapsbelasting / impôt des sociétés) applies to the worldwide income of companies that are tax-resident in Belgium, as well as to the Belgian-source income of non-resident companies operating through a permanent establishment. The tax is levied on profits as determined under Belgian accounting and tax law, subject to various adjustments and deductions.

Belgium operates a tiered rate structure, with different rates applying to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to larger corporations. This distinction is intended to support entrepreneurship and reduce the tax burden on smaller businesses.

## Standard Corporate Tax Rates

Large corporations are subject to the standard corporate income tax rate. SMEs, defined according to specific size criteria relating to turnover, balance sheet total, and employee count, may benefit from reduced rates on the first tranche of their taxable profits.

The definition of an SME for tax purposes is separate from other regulatory definitions and must be verified carefully each tax year. Companies that exceed the SME thresholds in consecutive years will lose access to the reduced rates.

## Taxable Income and Adjustments

Taxable income begins with accounting profit as determined under Belgian GAAP (or IFRS, where applicable), and is then adjusted for tax purposes. Common adjustments include the disallowance of certain expenses, the application of favorable tax depreciation regimes, and the deduction of exempt income.

Belgium imposes strict rules on the deductibility of expenses. To be deductible, expenses must be incurred to acquire or maintain taxable income, be supported by adequate documentation, and not fall within specific categories of non-deductible costs (such as certain fines, excessive remuneration, or non-business-related expenses).

## Innovation Income Deduction

One of the most significant tax incentives available to Belgian companies is the innovation income deduction (formerly known as the patent income deduction). This regime allows companies to deduct a substantial portion of qualifying intellectual property income from their taxable base, effectively reducing the tax burden on income derived from patents, software copyrights, and certain other IP assets.

Eligibility for this deduction depends on meeting strict conditions regarding the ownership, development, and exploitation of the IP. The regime is designed to comply with international standards on harmful tax practices and has been adjusted over time to align with OECD guidance.

## Other Deductions and Incentives

Belgium offers a range of additional deductions and incentives aimed at encouraging investment, research and development, and employment. These include accelerated depreciation for certain assets, enhanced deductions for R&D expenditure, and favorable treatment of risk capital.

Companies may also benefit from notional interest deduction (NID) regimes, which allow a deduction for a notional return on equity, reducing the tax bias in favor of debt financing. The exact parameters and availability of these incentives are subject to periodic legislative changes.

## Loss Carryforward and Carryback

Corporate losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable profits, subject to certain limitations and anti-abuse provisions. Belgium does not currently allow general loss carryback, meaning losses cannot be offset against prior years' profits to generate refunds, except in very limited circumstances.

Companies undergoing ownership changes or restructurings must pay careful attention to rules that may restrict or eliminate the ability to use accumulated losses.

## Filing and Compliance Obligations

Belgian companies must file an annual corporate income tax return, typically within a set period following the end of their financial year. The return must be accompanied by detailed financial statements and supporting schedules.

In addition to the annual return, companies are required to make advance tax payments throughout the year. Failure to make sufficient advance payments can result in interest charges. Companies must also comply with transfer pricing documentation requirements, country-by-country reporting (for large multinationals), and various other disclosure obligations.
