The Belgium-France Double Taxation Treaty, signed in 1964 and updated through multiple protocols, governs the allocation of taxing rights between the two countries for residents and businesses operating across the border. The treaty follows OECD principles while incorporating specific provisions reflecting the unique economic and cultural ties between Belgium and France.

Employment income is generally taxed in the country of residence unless the work is performed in the other country for more than 183 days within a 12-month period. Cross-border commuters who work in France but reside in Belgium (or vice versa) face special rules, with France typically retaining primary taxing rights for income earned on French territory. Belgium then provides a foreign tax credit or exemption to avoid double taxation.

The treaty sets reduced withholding tax rates on passive income: dividends are subject to 15% withholding (or 0% for certain parent-subsidiary relationships), interest payments face 10% withholding with numerous exemptions, and royalties are taxed at 5%. These reduced rates make cross-border investment more attractive and reduce the cost of capital for multinational groups.

Real estate income and capital gains from real property are taxed in the country where the property is located, regardless of the owner's residence. This rule has significant implications for Belgians purchasing French vacation homes or French residents investing in Belgian real estate.

The treaty includes exchange of information provisions and mutual assistance clauses that have been strengthened in recent years to combat tax evasion and ensure transparency. Both countries participate in the OECD's automatic exchange of information framework, sharing data on financial accounts, employment income, and other relevant information.

For Belgian residents with French income or assets, and French residents with Belgian connections, understanding treaty provisions is essential for tax planning and compliance. Professional guidance ensures optimal use of treaty benefits while meeting all reporting obligations.
