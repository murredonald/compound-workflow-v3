The Belgium-Netherlands Double Taxation Treaty, most recently amended in 2019, provides comprehensive rules for allocating taxing rights between the two countries and preventing double taxation on income and capital. Given the significant economic integration and cross-border workforce between Belgium and the Netherlands, this treaty is among the most frequently applied in the region.

For employment income, the treaty follows the standard OECD model: residents are taxed in their country of residence unless they work in the other country for more than 183 days per year, in which case the work state has primary taxing rights. Special provisions apply to cross-border workers, directors' fees, pensions, and government employment. Frontier workers who commute daily face specific rules that often result in taxation in the work country with credit mechanisms in the residence country.

Dividend withholding tax is reduced to 15% under the treaty, or 5% for substantial shareholdings (at least 10% ownership). Interest payments are generally taxed only in the recipient's country of residence, with limited exceptions. Royalties face a 5% withholding rate, significantly lower than domestic rates.

The treaty includes anti-abuse provisions aligned with the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, limiting treaty shopping and artificial arrangements designed solely to access treaty benefits. Mutual agreement procedures and exchange of information provisions facilitate cooperation between Belgian and Dutch tax authorities in resolving disputes and combating tax evasion.

Understanding treaty provisions is critical for Belgian residents with Dutch income sources, Dutch residents working in Belgium, and businesses operating across the border. Professional advice is essential for optimizing treaty relief and ensuring compliance with both countries' reporting requirements.
