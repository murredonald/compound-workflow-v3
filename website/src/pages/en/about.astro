        <h2 class="text-h2 font-bold mb-6">Our Story</h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-body text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            <strong class="text-foreground">Auryth was born from frustration</strong> — not from a pitch deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            For over a decade, our team has lived inside Belgian tax. We've sat in the offices of <strong class="text-foreground">law firms, Big Four advisory teams, accounting practices, family offices, and corporate tax departments</strong> across Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. We've done the work: navigating the WIB, cross-referencing circulars, chasing down rulings across Fisconetplus, Jura, and Monkey — often for hours, just to be confident in a single answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also happen to be deeply technical — from both sides. One of us has been programming in Python for years and was working with <strong class="text-foreground">natural language processing long before anyone called it "AI."</strong> Algorithmic trading, early OpenAI models like DaVinci, custom-built RAG systems — we were implementing this technology for our own work well before it had a name that trended on LinkedIn. The other spent years as a <strong class="text-foreground">technology consultant advising major financial institutions</strong> — designing systems, managing complex transformations, and understanding firsthand what it takes to build tools that professionals in regulated industries actually trust and adopt.
          </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 py-2 my-8">
          <p class="text-h3 font-semibold text-foreground">
            "We didn't read about the problem in a market report. We lived it."
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-body text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            That combination — <strong class="text-foreground">deep tax expertise, hands-on AI experience, and enterprise technology consulting at the highest level</strong> — is what makes Auryth different. When we tested general-purpose AI models on real Belgian tax questions, we saw exactly what any experienced practitioner would see: confident answers that were <strong class="text-foreground">subtly, dangerously wrong</strong>. Outdated rates. Blended jurisdictions. Missing exceptions. No sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            We knew it could be done better. Not by making another chatbot that guesses, but by building a <strong class="text-foreground">research platform that thinks the way a tax professional thinks</strong> — methodically, with sources, with awareness of what changed and when.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's Auryth. <strong class="text-foreground">Every answer is scored for confidence. Every source is ranked by legal authority. Every claim can be verified.</strong>

          Most AI tools give you confident answers. We think that's dangerous — especially in tax.

            Every answer comes with a confidence score. When we're certain, we show you why. When we're not, we tell you — because you deserve to know how much weight to put on what we give you.

          <p class="text-body-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Not that we're always right — but that you'll always know where you stand. We'd rather give you an honest "we're not sure" than a convincing answer built on thin evidence. Because in tax, the cost of false certainty is always higher than the cost of knowing your limits.
