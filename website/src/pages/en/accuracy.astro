          <p>
            Most AI tools give you confident answers. We think that's dangerous — especially in tax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Auryth works differently. When we're certain, we show you why. When we're not, we tell you. Every answer comes with a confidence score — not because we've figured everything out, but because we believe you deserve to know how much weight to put on what we give you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also believe AI shouldn't be a black box. You can see which sources informed an answer, how they were ranked, and why certain provisions were considered but set aside. Not because we want to overwhelm you with technical detail, but because as a professional, your judgment should always be the final word — and you can only exercise it if you can see what's behind the curtain.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's our promise: not that we're always right, but that you'll always know where you stand.
